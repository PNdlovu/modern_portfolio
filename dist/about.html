        <p> My name is Philani Ndlovu and I graduated in 2018 summer. I studied computing at Leicester College St Margaret Campus in 2014 and continued to obtain a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Business Information Systems at De Montfort University in 2018.</p>

        <p>My primary focus and inspiration for studying Business Information Systems was to pursue a career in software development. During my studies at a university level, I fell in love with Agile methods and management module, the language introduced was ruby on rails. I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about software Development, and strive to better myself as a graduate developer, and the development community.</p>
